* [daniel] Modular htmlstream
  Htmlstream should be modular enough to have plugin access methods
  for various ways of reading html, like files, http, etc.

* [daniel] Translators (bigger than gtkhtml2, but yummie)
  Translators a'la BeOS is a great thing. A translator is a module
  that knows how to read certain dataformats and transform them into
  others. If the system has a translator for a certain format, all
  programs using the parent "mime-type" (e g: image) may access data
  of that format. So an app that can only read png may use the
  png->jpeg translator to render a jpeg. Gtkhtml2 should use
  translators just like everyone else ;-)
